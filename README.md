### Problem Statement

The engagement on a platform becomes apathetic when viewed generally. Our goal is to build a connection and enhance the vitality of platform usage among young audiences by improving fashion styling.

Our solution, "Engagement on a Shopping Platform," introduces two key features:

1. **ADD ON ME: Personalized Mannequin Feature**:
   - Users select their body type and complexion to create a personalized mannequin.
   - This feature uses 3D modeling software like Clo3D for animation and visualization.

2. **This or That: Outfit Comparison Feature**:
   - Users are presented with two outfit options side-by-side to choose their preference.
   - This feature uses tools like Adobe XD or Figma for better shopping experience and virtual try-ons.
